# Legacy scripts

Files here are one-off tools that have not been merged into the main 
set of admin scripts yet. Additional work is needed to:
1. Verify correctness
1. Verify updatedness (that it works with recent versions of xcat)
1. Verify relevance (it is still needed and hasn't been replaced by something else)
1. Simplify by using functions in `xcat-tools/libs/`
1. Genericize by removing any site specific names, paths, etc.
1. Verify proper install by `setup.sh`.
